**Short blurb on what this repo is**

- Personal experimentation to review/interpret fun CNN Layers + classic ML classifiers (KNN, SVM, Softmax).
- Implementations from scratch - more like rough sketches than polished code.
- Not a comprehensive guide, just personal notes and memory aids.
- Think of this as a digital scratchpad rather than a tutorial.
