**Short blurb**

CNNs are a pretty unique architecture- turns out inductive bias is pretty powerful.

## Classifiers (to get us warmed up)

These are the basic linear models that are still at the core of a whole bunch of machine learning techniques.

- KNN
- SVM
- Softmax

## Sample CNN architectures

Some replications I've included
- Original LeNet architecture
- VGG finetuning sample

I've also put together a little demo on constructing adversarial examples- turns out it's pretty easy to fool even the most robust classifiers into thinking a "5" is a "1". Just takes some gradient manipulation.
